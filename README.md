# Chip8Emu
My implementation of a Chip-8 emulator, cause I decided to fool around with
emulators.

## Goal
I dunno, probably stop myself from doing anything with emulators ever again.
Also learn Zig?

## Current State
I am trying to load a program described in a file to memory.

## TODO
[X] Learn about the zig build system so that I can:
1. call "zig build run <filename>" to run a specific file from the command line
2. call "zig build test" to run all tests

[ ] Open up a window so that I can print the result of the read instructions
